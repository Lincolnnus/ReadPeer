iPad Split View Application, To Get Public Annotations from ReadPeer Web Service.

-------
I am a computer engineering undergraduate student in National University of Singapore. I study multimedia processing which involves information retrieval, database,image processing,etc.


-------
This is an application to help discover similar annotations other people make in the same book the reader is currently reading.

The user can simply take a picture of the book page he/she is currently reading. The app will get the text from picture and search relevant text annotations in the online web annotation service. The web annotation service system,http://readpeer.com is another project I developed for social reading in school. The search API is developed based on some famous information retrieval algorithms. 

Unfortunately, the web annotation service dataset is a bit too small at this moment and you may not get the desired annotations when testing the application.You may test one of the test images I screenshoted in the system.
