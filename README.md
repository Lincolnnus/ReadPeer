iPad Split View Application, To Get Public Annotations from ReadPeer Web Service.

-------
I am a computer engineering undergraduate student in National University of Singapore. I study multimedia processing which involves information retrieval, database,image processing,etc.

This is an application to help discover similar annotations other people make in the same book the reader is currently reading.

The user can simply take a picture of the book page he/she is currently reading. The app will get the text from picture and search relevant text annotations in the online web annotation service. The web annotation service system,readpeer.com is another project I developed for social reading in school. The search API is developed based on some famous information retrieval algorithms. 

Unfortunately, the web annotation service dataset is a bit too small at this moment and you may not get the desired annotations when testing the application.You may test one of the test images I screenshoted in the system.
